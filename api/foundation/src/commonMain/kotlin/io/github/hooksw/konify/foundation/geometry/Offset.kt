/**
 * An immutable 2D floating-point offset.
 *
 * Generally speaking, Offsets can be interpreted in two ways:
 *
 * 1. As representing a point in Cartesian space a specified distance from a
 *    separately-maintained origin. For example, the top-left position of
 *    children in the [RenderBox] protocol is typically represented as an
 *    [Offset] from the top left of the parent box.
 *
 * 2. As a vector that can be applied to coordinates. For example, when
 *    painting a [RenderObject], the parent is passed an [Offset] from the
 *    screen's origin which it can add to the offsets of its children to find
 *    the [Offset] from the screen's origin to each of the children.
 *
 * Because a particular [Offset] can be interpreted as one sense at one time
 * then as the other sense at a later time, the same class is used for both
 * senses.
 *
 * See also:
 *
 *  * [Size], which represents a vector describing the size of a rectangle.
 *
 * Creates an offset. The first argument sets [x], the horizontal component,
 * and the second sets [y], the vertical component.
